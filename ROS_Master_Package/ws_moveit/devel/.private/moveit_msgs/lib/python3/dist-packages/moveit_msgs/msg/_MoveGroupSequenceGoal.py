MSG: moveit_msgs/VisibilityConstraint
# The constraint is useful to maintain visibility to a disc (the target) in a particular frame.
# This disc forms the base of a visibiliy cone whose tip is at the origin of the sensor.
# Maintaining visibility is done by ensuring the robot does not obstruct the visibility cone.
# Note:
# This constraint does NOT enforce minimum or maximum distances between the sensor
# and the target, nor does it enforce the target to be in the field of view of
# the sensor. A PositionConstraint can (and probably should) be used for such purposes.

# The radius of the disc that should be maintained visible
float64 target_radius

# The pose of the disc; as the robot moves, the pose of the disc may change as well
# This can be in the frame of a particular robot link, for example

# From the sensor origin towards the target, the disc forms a visibility cone
# This cone is approximated using many sides. For example, when using 4 sides,
# that in fact makes the visibility region be a pyramid.
# This value should always be 3 or more.
int32 cone_sides

# The pose in which visibility is to be maintained.
# The frame id should represent the robot link to which the sensor is attached.
# It is assumed the sensor can look directly at the target, in any direction.
# This assumption is usually not true, but additional PositionConstraints
# can resolve this issue.
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped sensor_pose

# Even though the disc is maintained visible, the visibility cone can be very small
# because of the orientation of the disc with respect to the sensor. It is possible
# for example to view the disk almost from a side, in which case the visibility cone
# can end up having close to 0 volume. The view angle is defined to be the angle between
# the normal to the visibility disc and the direction vector from the sensor origin.
# The value below represents the minimum desired view angle. For a perfect view,
# this value will be 0 (the two vectors are exact opposites). For a completely obstructed view
# this value will be Pi/2 (the vectors are perpendicular). This value defined below
# is the maximum view angle to be maintained. This should be a value in the open interval
# (0, Pi/2). If 0 is set, the view angle is NOT enforced.
float64 max_view_angle

# This angle is used similarly to max_view_angle but limits the maximum angle
# between the sensor origin direction vector and the axis that connects the
# sensor origin to the target frame origin. The value is again in the range (0, Pi/2)
# and is NOT enforced if set to 0.
