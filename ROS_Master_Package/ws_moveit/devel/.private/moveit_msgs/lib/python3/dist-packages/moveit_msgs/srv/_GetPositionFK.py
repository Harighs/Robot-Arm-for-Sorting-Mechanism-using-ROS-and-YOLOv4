#  * the velocity of the joint (rad/s or m/s) and 
#  * the effort that is applied in the joint (Nm or N).

# Each joint is uniquely identified by its name
# The header specifies the time at which the joint states were recorded. All the joint states

# and those 3DOF can be expressed as a transformation matrix, and that transformation
